# Defining-Idiosyncratic-Volatility
What part of the implicit vol movement can be explained by the underlying spot and the global market ?

This project is based on Deutsche BÃ¶rse's A7 service which provides intraday prices and visualization tools for all Xetra and Eurex instruments.
Using this service, our earlier Git https://github.com/canari-dev/Trades-Dynamics-with-Deutsche-Boerse-A7 shows how to get implicit volatility and forwards from options prices.
(see PricingAndCalibration.py and associated files)

Building on this work, we are now going to define Idiosyncratic vol. Indeed, Canari.dev runs machine learning algorithms on market related time series in order to predict parameters move.

When focusing on single stock options implicit volatility, Canari.dev focuses on the part of the movement of the vol which cannot be explained by the underlying/Eurstoxx50 movement, what we call the idiosyncratic volatility :

There are two reasons for that :

1/ The more a delta is specific and hard to trade, the most likely one is to be able to find strong predictive signal because its price is less driven by arbitragers.
That's why the idiosyncratic vol is where we should look for strong signals. And in Machine Learning, you can not chase the proverbial two rabbits, so best focus on this part.
Another way to put it is that SX5E volatility and underlying stocks are very easy to trade and subject to intensive arbitrages so coming up with forecast signal on these would require very different techniques and should be seen as a separate job.

2/ A canArI user would rightly argue that the performance of his investment in options is determined by the "whole volatility", not not just idiosyncratic part of its futures moves. Two possibilities for them : either to neutralize the impact of underlying / Eurostoxx50 moves with cheap (in terms of bid-offer spread) hedging, or suplement the idiosyncratic estimator with another one focused specifically on stock moves and global (ie. SX5E) volatility.

# Now let's see what we really mean by idiosyncratic vol :

The Jupyter Notebook provided here shows how to run a regression betwwen the volatility moves and explanatory factors.
We will focus on 3 instances :

1/ Regressing the volatility moves on simulatneous underlying spot moves (*)

(This idea is linked to the measure of realized smile)

Results :

Graph : R2 factor of the regression ie. how much of the variance of Y can be explained by the regressors

Conclusions :
The fixed strike vol is very close to the idiosyncratic vol (which would have 0% of R2).
It is much better than the ATM vol which is very much linked to moves.


2/ Adding the Eurostoxx50 spot and vol as regressors (*)

Results :

Graph : It is now a multiregression with 3 Xs : Underlying spot move, SX5E vol move, SX5E spot move

Context : 
R^2 of an OLS regression on maturities between 2 and 12 months.
All data capped at 3 standard deviations
Period from April 2nd, 2019 to january the 31st, 2020.
ATM vol is the at the money vol (Strike = Forward)
Fixed strike vol is the vol of a strike fixed on the forward at the beginning of the period
Forward vol is the forward vol between the nearby maturity and the considered maturity
This question was important for us because our analysis focuses on the idiosyncratic vol and filters out movements which can be explained/hedged with unforecastable/liquid instruments like the underlying or the reference index (SX5E) vol/spot. 
Following this study, we are likely to use fixed strike vol in order to graph vol movements for our users as it is closer to the idiosyncratic vol (ie. it doesn't carry additional variance steaming from unforecastable spot moves).

Another idea was to use forward vol which is also less influenced by spot moves. This study doesn't encourage the use of forward vol as a proxy of the idiosyncratic vol, as the R2 of the regression on spot move is similar to the one with ATM vol. 
The reason for this is that the overall variance of the forward vol is much smaller than the ATM volatility variance (by a factor 2). Indeed, it is a stable, differentiated parameter. So the variance explained by the spot move, is small but still represents a large chunk of the overall variance.
